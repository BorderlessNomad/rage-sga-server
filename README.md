# RAGE Social Gamification APIs a.k.a. *SGA*
## Overview
This module allows to layer game mechanics affording game-inspired social relations and interactions on top a system to support engagement, collaboration, and learning. Two main forms of social interaction are supported: player-player interactions (such as matches) and group interactions (such as shared team goals or team vs. team competitions).
